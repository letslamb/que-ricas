We are not your ordinary restaurant. We realize that as a business, we have a responsibility to contribute to our community. This purpose and responsibility translates into the ingredients we choose to cook with, the food we serve, what we package our To-Go foods in, and how we respect and treat our customers and community. We invite you to not only come and try our family's treasured recipes, but we also encourage you to ask us any questions you may have about our menu! We treat you and our community like the family that you are.
