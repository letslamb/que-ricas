Que Ricas brings to you authentic and inspired South American cuisine using only the best ingredients.  We feature specialties like Venezuelan-Style Empanadas, Arepas, Pabell√≥n Bowls, Churros and more, which are all made here in our kitchen from scratch!  Those new to South American food will find some surprisingly familiar flavor profiles on the menu to help you test the beautiful waters of this little-known cuisine.  We take pride in our selection of all-natural meats, organic and non-GMO fruits and vegetables, and locally sourced ingredients.

As a business, we have the responsibility to serve food that brings health to the individual as well as prosperity to our community and planet.  This belief translates clearly in our menu that offers many healthy farm-to-table options that are free from harmful chemicals.  We also do our best to reduce waste in our kitchen and have swapped out Styrofoam for biodegradable containers.  This is our commitment to you: to be responsible to our planet and to treat you like we would our family...because you are!
