Bienvenidos! Welcome! Que Ricas brings to you authentic and locally inspired South American flavors, heavily influenced by Venezuelan cuisine. We feature specialties like Empanadas, Arepas, Pabell√≥n Bowls, Seasonal Specials, Churros and more all made here in our kitchen from scratch. There are many words to describe our menu: traditional, honest, intriguing, inspiring, rica...you just have to try it!

We are not your ordinary restaurant. We realize that as a business, we have a responsibility to contribute to our community. This purpose and responsibility translates into the ingredients we choose to cook with, the food we serve, what we package our To-Go foods in, and how we respect and treat our customers and community. We invite you to not only come and try our family's treasured recipes, but we also encourage you to ask us any questions you may have about our menu! We treat you and our community like the family that you are.
