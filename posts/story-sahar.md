Sahar Soleymani learned her way around the kitchen at an early age as much of her home life was centered on the pride and tradition that came with preparing food of her rich Venezuelan and Iranian heritage. A deep love for food, creativity and her community spirit inspire her to serve her community honest food that represents her roots. This passion and love for food is in the bloodline as her family has been in the restaurant business and serving the community for over 40 years. For the first
time ever, at Que Ricas, Sahar will be cooking her familyâ€™s prized recipes for South Jersey to fall in love with.
